# Easyship Developer Challenge
## Guidelines

- **Repository**: Create a private repository in Github and share it with us
- **Bugs**: Fix bugs you find and feel free to suggest changes to make the codes cleaner
- **Git Workflow**: For each task, create a new feature branch. Base first branch off `master`, and any of the rest off its previous one
- **Review**: Open a PR and request reviews once the latest task you work on is completed. We prefer review-first workflow to make sure coding direction is correct before moving on to next task(s)
- **Test**: To ensure code changes adhere to the desired functionality, please write tests using RSpec
